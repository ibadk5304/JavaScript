Description: Erewhon Mobile charges cellular customers a rate based on the total amount of data used by a customer in the billing period. For simplicity, customers are charge based on which range their total data usage falls within. Note, it is not a cumulative charge; your program will figure out which single range the usage falls into, then calculate the cost based on that rangeâ€™s cost. 
Total Data Usage 	Rate of Charge 
Up to and including 200Mb 	$20.00 flat rate 
Over 200Mb and up to and including 500Mb 	$0.105 per Mb 
Over 500Mb and up to and including 1Gb 	$0.110 per Mb 
Over 1Gb 	$118.00 flat rate

Pseudo code
1. Start the program
2. Taking input of data usage 
3.Promt to add a function called dataChargeCalculator.
4.In processing, four condition.
5. Output the Total charge 
6. End the program
